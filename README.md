It's ThatBot, but written in JavaScript!

A personal Discord bot built using discord.js

I'm still pretty new to the world of programming and I'm learning quite a lot of things. I decided to code a Discord bot because I'll learn more and become better at coding as opposed to just watching videos and reading on how to code.

This bot so far is much better than my Python one which you can see [here](https://github.com/faizal101/ThatBot), I'm using a command handler for one~

Feel free to add this bot to your server. Sure it may not do anything unique for now, ~~but it can post smugs~~ but overtime I'll add more features to it.
Also feel free to send me yuri pics :^)
